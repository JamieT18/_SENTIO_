# Accessibility and UX Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the accessibility and user experience improvements made to the Sentio 2.0 dashboard to ensure WCAG AA compliance and provide an excellent user experience for all users.

## Key Improvements

### 1. ARIA Labels and Semantic HTML

**What was added:**
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements (buttons, forms, navigation)
- Proper `role` attributes for semantic elements
- `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates
- `aria-selected` for tab navigation
- `aria-controls` to link tabs with their panels
- `scope` attributes for table headers
- Descriptive labels for form inputs with `htmlFor` and `id` attributes

**Impact:**
- Screen readers can now properly announce all interactive elements
- Users understand the purpose of each element
- Dynamic content changes are announced to assistive technology users

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

**What was added:**
- Enhanced focus indicators with visible outlines (3px cyan border)
- Tab navigation through all interactive elements
- Enter/Space key support for buttons and toggles
- Escape key to close dialogs and modals
- Arrow keys for navigation in onboarding flow
- Skip to main content link for keyboard users

**Impact:**
- Users can navigate the entire dashboard without a mouse
- Focus states are clearly visible
- Keyboard shortcuts improve efficiency

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `Tab` - Navigate through elements
- `Enter` - Activate buttons and submit forms
- `Escape` - Close dialogs and modals
- `Arrow Left/Right` - Navigate onboarding steps
- Click "Skip to main content" when focused - Jump directly to main content

### 3. Color Contrast (WCAG AA Compliance)

**Current Standards:**
- Light text (#e2e8f0) on dark backgrounds (#0f1729): **12.5:1** ✅
- Muted text (#94a3b8) on dark backgrounds (#0f1729): **7.2:1** ✅
- Cyan accent (#4fd1c5) on dark backgrounds (#0f1729): **8.9:1** ✅

All color combinations exceed WCAG AA requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).

### 4. Onboarding Flow

**Features:**
- 6-step guided tour for new users
- Progressive disclosure of dashboard features

**How to trigger:**
- Automatically shows for first-time users
- Stored in localStorage as `onboarding_completed`
- Can be reset by clearing localStorage

**Accessibility Features:**
- `role="dialog"` with `aria-modal="true"`
- Focus trap within modal
- Descriptive step indicators
- Progress announced via `aria-live`

### 5. Notification Preferences

## Developer Guidelines

### When Adding New Components

1. **Always include:**
   - ARIA labels for interactive elements
   - Keyboard event handlers
   - Focus management
   - Proper semantic HTML

2. **Example:**
```jsx
<button
  onClick={handleClick}
  onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleClick()}
  aria-label="Descriptive action"
  className="btn-primary"
>
  Button Text
</button>
```

3. **Test with:**
   - Keyboard only (unplug mouse)
   - Screen reader
   - Browser zoom at 200%
   - Color contrast checker

### ARIA Best Practices

1. Use semantic HTML first (button, nav, main, header)
2. Add ARIA when semantic HTML isn't enough
3. Don't override native semantics unnecessarily
4. Test with actual assistive technology
5. Keep ARIA labels descriptive but concise
